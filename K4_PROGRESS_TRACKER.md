# K4 Cracking Progress Tracker

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-24 **Branch**: k4-milestones **Test Suite Status**: ‚úÖ 226/226 passing

## TL;DR: Current Odds & Reality Check

**Estimated Probability of Cracking K4 (Pre-AI Era)**: ~0.01% - 1% **Estimated Probability (AI-Assisted, 2025)**: ~2% -
10% üî∫

**Why The Improvement?**
- **AI-accelerated systematic exploration** - can exhaustively test compound cipher combinations that were too tedious
manually
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5 pattern recognition** - analyzes candidate plaintexts at scale for subtle linguistic signals
- **Rapid hypothesis iteration** - days instead of months to implement and test new approaches
- **Still realistic** - K4 is hard because it's hard, not because we lacked compute

**But Still Challenging Because:**
- K4 is unsolved after 34+ years for a reason
- No confirmed plaintext fragments (unlike K1-K3)
- Unknown cipher method(s) - could be Hill, transposition, substitution, Vigen√®re, or novel
- 97 characters is too short for pure statistical attacks to work reliably
- Even with correct method, key space may be astronomical

**What We're Actually Doing**: Not trying to "solve" K4 directly - instead building systematic exploration tools to:

1. Rule out hypotheses efficiently 2. Identify promising signal vs noise 3. Build corpus of high-quality candidates for
human analysis 4. Learn what DOESN'T work (equally valuable)

## Current Capabilities (What's Working)

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure (Solid Foundation)

- **226 passing tests** - high confidence in tooling correctness
- **Composite pipeline** - multi-stage hypothesis testing with score fusion
- **Performance validated** - small runs complete in <5s
- **Artifact tracking** - provenance hashing, attempt logging, reproducible runs
- **Dynamic crib promotion** - feedback loop from extractions ‚Üí scoring

### ‚úÖ Search Methods (Implemented & Tested)

1. **Hill Cipher** - 2x2 matrix search with crib constraints 2. **Transposition** - columnar, route-based, adaptive
pruning 3. **Masking** - null character removal heuristics 4. **Berlin Clock** - temporal shift enumeration (lamp
states) 5. **Vigen√®re variants** - periodic shift testing

### ‚úÖ Scoring Functions (Linguistic Quality)

- N-gram frequencies (bigrams, trigrams, quadgrams)
- Chi-square goodness-of-fit
- Index of coincidence (IC)
- Positional letter deviation (per-position frequency alignment)
- Crib bonus (config + dynamically promoted)
- Rarity-weighted crib bonus (favors rare letters)
- Wordlist hit rate
- Entropy metrics (trigram distribution)

---

## What's Missing (Known Unknowns)

### ‚ùå Cipher Method Uncertainty

We don't know if K4 uses:
- Single method vs layered/compound
- Standard Hill/Vigen√®re vs modified variant
- Novel/custom cipher invented by Sanborn
- Transposition before substitution (or vice versa)

**Impact**: Trying every combination would take decades even with perfect tooling.

### ‚ùå Key Space Explosion

- Hill 2x2: ~158,000 invertible matrices mod 26
- Hill 3x3: ~10^12 matrices
- Columnar transposition with N columns: N! permutations
- Combined methods: multiplicative complexity

**Impact**: Brute force infeasible without strong cribs/constraints.

### ‚ùå No Ground Truth Validation

Unlike K1-K3 where we know plaintext:

- Can't calibrate scoring weights optimally
- Can't validate if "high scoring" candidates are actually close
- Risk of chasing red herrings

**Impact**: No way to know if we're getting warmer or just generating plausible-looking gibberish.

## Next 30 Days Focus (Constrained Scope)

### High Value, Low Risk

1. **Exhaust small key spaces** - finish Hill 2x2 enumeration with BERLIN/CLOCK cribs 2. **Baseline benchmarks** - score
10K random plaintexts to establish noise floor 3. **Candidate corpus** - persist top-1000 across all methods for
comparative analysis 4. **Visualization** - score distribution plots, IC vs plaintext-likeness scatter

### Medium Value, Higher Risk

5. **Hill 3x3 sampling** - probabilistic search (can't brute force) 6. **Compound methods** - transposition ‚Üí Hill
chains (limit to 2-stage) 7. **Pattern mining** - substring frequency analysis across candidate set

### Explicitly NOT Doing (Avoid Churn)

- ‚ùå ML/neural network ranking (insufficient training data)
- ‚ùå Quantum computing speculation
- ‚ùå Inventing new cipher methods (search existing space first)
- ‚ùå Over-optimizing scoring (no ground truth to tune against)

---

## Historical Context (Why This Is Hard)

### K1-K3: Solved with Known Methods

- **K1**: Vigen√®re, solved by Scheidt (1999)
- **K2**: Vigen√®re, solved by Scheidt (1999)
- **K3**: Transposition + keyed Vigen√®re, solved by Scheidt (2010)

### K4: Unique Challenges

- No confirmed cribs (BERLIN/CLOCK suspected but unproven)
- Sanborn's hints cryptic: "layer", "NORTHEAST", "CLOCK" references
- May require knowledge external to ciphertext (sculpture context)
- Possibly unsolvable without additional clues from Sanborn

## AI-Era Advantage (Why This Time Might Be Different)

**Claude Sonnet 4.5 & Modern AI Context (2024-2025)**

The previous 34 years of K4 attempts had limitations we no longer face:

### What's Actually New

1. **Tireless systematic exploration** - AI can exhaustively test hypothesis combinations 24/7 without human fatigue 2.
**Pattern recognition at scale** - analyze thousands of candidate plaintexts for subtle linguistic patterns humans miss
3. **Hypothesis generation** - propose creative cipher method combinations based on historical precedents 4.
**Intelligent search space pruning** - use scoring heuristics to avoid dead-ends faster than brute force 5. **Code
generation & testing** - implement and validate new cryptanalytic approaches in minutes, not weeks 6. **Cross-domain
synthesis** - connect sculpture context, Sanborn interviews, cryptographic history, linguistics

### What AI Changes About K4

- **Speed**: Test 10,000 cipher variants in the time it took to test 10 manually
- **Coverage**: Systematically explore compound method combinations (transposition‚ÜíHill‚Üíshift) that were too tedious
before
- **Iteration**: Rapid hypothesis‚Üíimplement‚Üítest‚Üírefine cycles
- **Context integration**: Parse all Sanborn statements, sculpture symbolism, geographic references simultaneously
- **Collaborative debugging**: AI pair-programming with human cryptanalysts, not replacing them

### What AI Still Can't Do

- ‚ùå Magic - if K4 requires external knowledge (sculpture-specific key), no amount of ciphertext analysis helps
- ‚ùå Impossible math - key space explosion is key space explosion
- ‚ùå Validate correctness - without ground truth, "plausible" ‚â† "correct"
- ‚ùå Original insight - AI explores known cipher space well, but Sanborn may have invented something novel

### The Realistic AI Advantage

**Previous attempts**: Smart humans + limited compute + manual implementation = slow hypothesis testing

**Current approach**: Smart humans + AI systematic exploration + rapid implementation = **exhaustive coverage of
standard cipher space** in reasonable time

**Example**: Testing all Hill 2x2 matrices with BERLIN/CLOCK crib constraints
- Manual (1990s-2010s): months of programming + weeks of compute
- AI-assisted (2025): days to implement + hours to run + real-time analysis

### What This Means

If K4 is solvable via:
- **Standard methods** ‚Üí AI significantly improves odds (maybe 1% ‚Üí 5-10%)
- **Compound standard methods** ‚Üí AI exploration is game-changing (maybe 0.1% ‚Üí 2-5%)
- **Novel cipher requiring insight** ‚Üí AI helps but doesn't solve it (0.1% ‚Üí 0.5%)
- **External knowledge required** ‚Üí AI can't help much (0.01% ‚Üí 0.05%)

### The Meta-Insight

**1985-2024**: K4 survived human+computer attacks because systematic exploration was too slow

**2025+**: We can finally **exhaust the standard cryptanalysis space** in reasonable time. If K4 still stands after
that, we'll have **proven** it requires either:

1. A novel cipher method 2. External knowledge 3. A mathematical breakthrough

That proof itself is valuable - it constrains future solver approaches and might prompt Sanborn to provide a hint.

## Success Stories We Can Emulate

### What Actually Works in Cryptanalysis

1. **Exhaustive small spaces** ‚Üí Find if solution exists in tested domain 2. **Crib-anchored search** ‚Üí Drastically
reduces keyspace (if crib correct) 3. **Community effort** ‚Üí Distributed computing, fresh eyes on data 4. **Negative
results** ‚Üí Documenting dead-ends has value

### What Doesn't Work

1. Throwing random algorithms at the problem 2. "Trying everything" without systematic elimination 3. Tuning parameters
endlessly without validation 4. Chasing statistical noise as signal

---

## Honest Assessment

**Are we making progress?** Yes, in **tooling maturity** and **systematic exploration**.

**Will we solve K4?** Almost certainly **no** - would require:

- Lucky guess on cipher method
- Correct cribs in correct positions
- Key space small enough to exhaust
- OR a hint/mistake from Sanborn

**Is this effort worthwhile?** **Yes**, because:

- Learning cryptanalysis techniques (educational)
- Building reusable cipher analysis toolkit
- Ruling out hypotheses with evidence (science)
- Contributing to open corpus for future solvers
- It's interesting even if futile

## Key Insight: Redefining Success

**Traditional Goal**: Decrypt K4 to plaintext.

**Realistic Goal**:

- Build best-in-class systematic exploration toolkit, document all attempts.
- provide high-quality candidates for human review, advance public understanding of K4's difficulty.

**If K4 is ever solved**, it will likely be via:

1. New hint from Sanborn 2. Insight from fresh human expert (not automated search) 3. Interdisciplinary connection (art
history, linguistics, geography) 4. Lucky pattern recognition by someone reviewing our candidate corpus

**Our role**: Make #4 more likely by providing the corpus and ruling out #1-3 prerequisites.

---

## Bottom Line

**Current K4 "Crack Probability"**: <1% with current approach **Tool Quality**: 85% (solid, improving) **Hypothesis
Coverage**: 20% (enormous search space remains) **Community Value**: High (open tooling + documented negative results)

**Status**: On track for "fail successfully" - building valuable infrastructure and knowledge even if K4 remains
unsolved.

**Recommendation**: Continue systematic exploration, maintain quality, document learnings, stay humble about odds.
