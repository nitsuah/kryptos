# K4 v1 Spine Implementation Summary

**Branch**: k4-milestones **Date**: 2025-10-23 **Status**: ✅ Complete - All tests green (226 passed)

## Objectives Achieved

Built minimal "intelligent loop": tuning/OPS run → SPY high-confidence extractions → promote new cribs → improved K4
candidate ranking → recorded decision artifact.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Hypothesis Protocol + Hill Stub
**Files Created**:
- `src/kryptos/k4/hypotheses.py` - Protocol defining hypothesis interface + HillCipherHypothesisStub

**Tests**:
- `tests/test_k4_hypotheses.py` - Previously skipped test now passing
- Reduced skipped hypothesis tests from 3 to 2

**Impact**: Established abstraction for pluggable K4 hypotheses; first hypothesis test activated.

---

### 2. Dynamic Crib Promotion Store
**Files Created**:
- `src/kryptos/spy/crib_store.py` - Load/save/promote functions with promotion rules

**Tests**:
- `tests/test_crib_store.py` - 6 tests covering promotion logic, validation, and size limits

**Promotion Rules**:
- Token must be A-Z only (uppercase)
- Length >= 3
- Confidence >= 0.8
- Observed in >= 2 distinct runs
- File size limit: 10KB (auto-trimmed keeping highest confidence)

**Impact**: Establishes feedback loop from extraction → persistent storage → scoring.

---

### 3. Crib-Aware Scoring Integration
**Files Modified**:
- `src/kryptos/k4/scoring.py` - Added `_get_all_cribs()` with mtime-cached promoted crib loading

**Tests**:
- `tests/test_crib_aware_scoring.py` - 2 tests verifying promoted cribs increase ranking

**Changes**:
- `crib_bonus()` - Now includes promoted cribs
- `rarity_weighted_crib_bonus()` - Now includes promoted cribs
- Mtime-based cache prevents redundant file reads

**Impact**: Candidates containing promoted cribs now rank higher in scoring.

---

### 4. Autopilot Crib Update Hook
**Files Modified**:
- `src/kryptos/autopilot.py` - Added `_update_cribs_from_spy()` and integration into `run_exchange()`

**Tests**:
- `tests/test_autopilot_crib_update.py` - Verifies crib update event logging

**Exception Handling**:
- Confirmed autopilot already uses narrow exception handling (RuntimeError, ValueError, OSError)
- Crib update failures logged but don't fail exchange

**Logging**:
- Structured JSON event: `{"event": "cribs_updated", "cribs_total": X, "new": Y, "timestamp": ...}`

**Impact**: Autopilot loop now automatically updates crib store after each exchange.

---

### 5. Performance Guard Test
**Files Created**:
- `tests/test_k4_performance.py` - Smoke test for composite pipeline runtime

**Constraints**:
- Small run (limit=5) must complete < 5 seconds
- Skippable via `PERF_DISABLE=1` environment variable
- Catches major performance regressions

**Impact**: CI can detect performance degradation early.

---

### 6. Deprecation Documentation
**Files Modified**:
- `docs/DEPRECATIONS.md` - Added K4 v1 Spine section
- `docs/ARCHIVED_SCRIPTS.md` - Updated timestamp and notes

**Status**:
- Legacy script audit complete
- Most marked REMOVE items already deleted
- Remaining items documented with target dates
- `scripts/tuning/pick_best_weight.py` scheduled for removal 2025-11-15

**Impact**: Clear deprecation timeline; no new legacy creep.

---

## Technical Debt Addressed

- ✅ No broad refactors (minimal targeted changes)
- ✅ Exception handling already narrowed in autopilot
- ✅ All new code has test coverage
- ✅ No new legacy script creep
- ✅ Deprecation timeline documented

---

## Next Steps (Deferred per constraints)

Following items were identified but deferred to avoid churn:

1. ❌ Unskip second hypothesis test (transposition constraint) - Wait for real implementation 2. ❌ Adaptive ML ranking -
Not needed for spine 3. ❌ Generalized plugin loaders - Premature abstraction 4. ❌ Multi-process search orchestrator -
Infrastructure not required yet 5. ❌ Physical deletion of pick_best_weight.py - Documented with removal date instead
