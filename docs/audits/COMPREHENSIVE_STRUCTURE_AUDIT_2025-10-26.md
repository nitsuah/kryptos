# Comprehensive Structure Audit - October 26, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Status**: Kryptos codebase is **functional and well-structured** but has **technical debt** in test coverage and
config usage that needs addressing.

**Key Findings**: 1. ✅ Core cryptanalysis functionality is solid and production-ready 2. ⚠️ llm_config.yaml is unused
(future work placeholder) 3. ⚠️ 4 tests skipped with "known Phase 6 gap" - these are technical debt 4. ⚠️ Test
assertions reference outdated success rates (3.8%, 27.5%) 5. ✅ 616 tests collected, most passing, but gaps exist

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. ❌ llm_config.yaml is UNUSED
**Location**: `config/llm_config.yaml` **Problem**: File exists but no code reads it **ops_director.py behavior**:
```python
def __init__(self, llm_provider: str = "openai", model: str = "gpt-4", ...):
    # Hardcoded defaults, ignores YAML
```

**Resolution Options**:
- **A)** Implement YAML loading in `ops_director.__init__()`
- **B)** Delete `llm_config.yaml` and document as future work
- **Recommendation**: Option B - mark as Phase 7 roadmap item

---

### 2. ⚠️ Test Technical Debt
**Skipped Tests** (need resolution):

```python
# tests/test_vigenere_key_recovery.py:296
@pytest.mark.skip("K1/K2 autonomous recovery: 3.8% success rate - known Phase 6 gap")
def test_k1_full_autonomous_solve(self):
    # ASPIRATIONAL: Full K1 solve with NO hints
```

**Problem**: Test exists but is permanently skipped as "aspirational"

**Resolution**:
- **Option A**: Delete test, document as future work in roadmap
- **Option B**: Move to `tests/aspirational/` directory
- **Option C**: Convert to xfail with explanation

**Recommendation**: Move to `tests/aspirational/` with README explaining these are research goals, not current
capabilities.

---

### 3. ⚠️ Deprecated Module Still in Use
**Location**: `k4/executor.py` **Status**: Marked DEPRECATED but still imported by tests **Action**: Migrate remaining
tests to `Pipeline` API, then delete

---

### 4. ⚠️ Deprecated Example Wrappers
**Files**:
- `examples/run_autopilot_demo.py`
- `examples/run_k4_demo.py`
- `examples/sample_composite_demo.py`
- `examples/sections_demo.py`

**Status**: Shims with deprecation warnings **Action**: Delete after confirming no external usage (check docs)

---

## Test Coverage Reality Check

### Current State
- **616 tests collected**
- **Passing**: Majority (exact count requires full run)
- **Skipped**: 4-5 tests marked as "known gaps"
- **Failed**: 1 performance test (timing threshold too strict)

### Test Categories
1. **Unit tests** (scoring, ciphers, agents): ✅ Comprehensive 2. **Integration tests** (pipelines, campaigns): ✅ Good
coverage 3. **Monte Carlo tests** (K3 autonomous solving): ✅ Statistical validation 4. **Aspirational tests** (K1/K2
full solve): ⚠️ Permanently skipped

### Recommended Actions
1. Run full `pytest --cov` to get actual coverage percentage 2. Move skipped tests to `tests/aspirational/` 3. Fix
performance test threshold or mark as xfail 4. Document known limitations in ROADMAP.md

---

## Config Usage Assessment

### config.json Usage: ⚠️ LIMITED
**Used in**:
- `k4/scoring.py` - loads cribs list
- `pipeline/k4_campaign.py` - demo function reads ciphertexts
- `pipeline/validator.py` - demo function reads cribs

**Issues**:
- 4 different path constructions to same file
- Not centralized through `paths.py`
- Most modules don't use it

**Recommendation**: Centralize via `paths.get_config_path()` helper

### llm_config.yaml Usage: ❌ NONE
**Status**: File exists, no code reads it **Recommendation**: Delete or implement loading

---

## Verdict: Is Kryptos at Its Finest?

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns 2. **Cryptanalysis**: Comprehensive K4 toolkit 3. **Provenance**:
Attack logging enables reproducibility 4. **Agents**: Autonomous specialists well-designed 5. **Testing**: Extensive
test suite (616 tests)

### ⚠️ Technical Debt
1. **Config**: llm_config.yaml unused 2. **Tests**: 4-5 skipped as "known gaps" 3. **Deprecated code**: executor.py,
example wrappers 4. **Documentation**: Success rates in comments don't match reality

### 🎯 To Reach "Finest"
1. ✅ Code cleanup: DONE (-2,877 lines, 98.5% success) 2. ⚠️ Config cleanup: Centralize config.json usage, resolve
llm_config.yaml 3. ⚠️ Test cleanup: Move aspirational tests, fix/xfail performance test 4. ⚠️ Delete deprecated: Remove
executor.py after test migration 5. ⚠️ Update docs: Align success rate claims with actual results

---

## Conclusion

**Kryptos is 90% at its finest.** The core functionality is solid, architecture is sound, and the codebase is
maintainable. The remaining 10% is:
- Unused config file
- Skipped tests masking as coverage
- Deprecated modules not yet removed
- Minor documentation staleness

**Estimated effort to reach 100%**: 4-6 hours of focused cleanup work.
