# Phase 7: K4 Solving Push

**Status**: Ready to begin (Phase 6 cleanup complete)

**Goal**: Use our clean, optimized codebase to make serious K4 solving attempts

## Why Now?

Phase 6 gave us:
- ‚úÖ -3,554 lines of cruft removed
- ‚úÖ Clean, lean codebase
- ‚úÖ Fast test suite (583 fast tests, ~1-2 min)
- ‚úÖ Optimized CI/CD
- ‚úÖ All infrastructure in place

**We have autonomous solvers that ACTUALLY CRACK K1, K2, and K3:**

### Proven Capability

**K1 (Vigen√®re)**: ‚úÖ AUTONOMOUS SOLVE
- Algorithm: Frequency analysis + dictionary ranking
- Success: 100% (deterministic) - PALIMPSEST always rank #1
- Test: `test_k1_monte_carlo_50runs()` - 50/50 successes
- Runtime: ~5 seconds per attempt

**K2 (Vigen√®re)**: ‚úÖ AUTONOMOUS SOLVE
- Algorithm: Same frequency analysis approach
- Success: 100% (deterministic) - ABSCISSA always in top 10
- Test: `test_k2_monte_carlo_50runs()` - 50/50 successes
- Runtime: ~8 seconds per attempt

**K3 (Columnar Transposition)**: ‚úÖ AUTONOMOUS SOLVE
- Algorithm: Simulated annealing permutation recovery
- Success: 20%+ (probabilistic) - recovered "SLOWLYDESPARATLY..."
- Test: `test_k3_autonomous_solving.py` - 4 tests PASSING
- Runtime: ~16 seconds for 4 period tests
- Note: Success rate varies by period complexity (5=easier, 7=harder)

### What This Means

We're not just running K1/K2/K3 with known keys - we're **discovering the keys autonomously** using:
- Frequency analysis (Vigen√®re)
- Simulated annealing (transposition)
- English language scoring
- Dictionary validation

**K4 is just harder, not impossible.** We have the tools.

## Phase 7 Objectives

### 1. Run K4 Solving Campaigns

**Week 1-2: Pure Hypothesis Testing**
- Run existing pipeline on K4 with current best parameters
- Test each hypothesis family independently:
  - Hill cipher (2x2, 3x3 with BERLIN/CLOCK cribs)
  - Transposition (columnar, route variants)
  - Masking (structural padding removal)
  - Berlin Clock shifts
  - Combo attacks (Hill ‚Üí Transposition, etc.)

**Deliverables:**
- Baseline success metrics for each approach
- Performance profiles (time per hypothesis)
- Top 100 candidates per approach saved to artifacts

### 2. Analyze & Tune

**Week 3: Deep Analysis**
- Review attempt logs from campaigns
- Identify promising patterns in top candidates
- Tune scoring weights based on what "almost worked"
- Adjust search parameters (SA temp, iterations, etc.)

**Deliverables:**
- Analysis report of top candidates
- Tuned parameter configs
- Hypothesis priority ranking

### 3. Agent-Driven Campaigns

**Week 4: Autonomous Iteration**
- Use OPS agent to run parallel hypothesis execution
- Use Q agent for statistical validation of candidates
- Use SPY agent for pattern extraction from results
- Let agents iterate and refine approaches

**Deliverables:**
- Agent-driven attempt logs
- Autonomous hypothesis refinement
- Convergence metrics

### 4. Breakthrough or Pivot

**End of Phase 7:**

If K4 cracks: üéâ
- Document solution methodology
- Publish results
- Celebrate solving 30+ year mystery

If K4 still unsolved: üî¨
- Phase 8: LLM integration for pattern recognition
- Phase 8 Alt: Advanced mathematical approaches (matrix analysis, etc.)
- We'll have comprehensive data on what doesn't work

## Success Metrics

**Must Have:**
- ‚úÖ 1000+ K4 solving attempts logged
- ‚úÖ Top 500 candidates analyzed and scored
- ‚úÖ Parameter tuning based on real results
- ‚úÖ Performance profiling complete

**Nice to Have:**
- ‚úÖ Agent autonomy demonstrated
- ‚úÖ Novel hypothesis combinations tested
- ‚úÖ Statistical convergence toward solution space

**Stretch Goal:**
- üéØ **CRACK K4** üéØ

## Technical Approach

### Pipeline Configuration

```python
# Example composite pipeline for K4
stages = [
    make_hill_constraint_stage(
        partial_len=30,
        partial_min=-200.0,
        cribs=["BERLIN", "CLOCK"]
    ),
    make_transposition_adaptive_stage(
        period_range=(5, 14),
        max_iterations=50000
    ),
    make_masking_stage(limit=5),
]

run_composite_pipeline(
    K4_CIPHERTEXT,
    stages,
    report=True,
    adaptive=True,  # Use adaptive weighting
    limit=100
)
```

### Scoring Strategy

Focus on: 1. **Quadgram scores** (high-quality table loaded) 2. **Wordlist hit rate** (real English words) 3. **Trigram
entropy** (natural distribution) 4. **Crib anchoring** (BERLIN, CLOCK, NORTHEAST, EAST)

### Compute Budget

Assuming:
- ~1-2 minutes per composite pipeline run (3 stages)
- 1000 attempts = ~16-33 hours of compute
- Can parallelize with OPS agent

**Strategy**: Run overnight campaigns, analyze results daily

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: K4 uses unknown cipher type we haven't implemented
- Mitigation: Comprehensive hypothesis coverage, ready to add new types

**Risk**: K4 requires key we can't derive
- Mitigation: Crib-based constraints, exhaustive search where feasible

**Risk**: Compute time too long
- Mitigation: Parallelization, cloud compute if needed

**Risk**: False positives (think we solved it but didn't)
- Mitigation: Q agent statistical validation, human review

## Resources Needed

- ‚úÖ Clean codebase (Phase 6 complete)
- ‚úÖ Fast test suite (Phase 6 complete)
- ‚úÖ Agent infrastructure (Phase 5 complete)
- ‚úÖ Scoring utilities (existing)
- ‚úÖ Pipeline framework (existing)
- ‚è≥ Compute time (overnight runs)
- ‚è≥ Analysis time (daily review)

## Timeline

**Phase 7 Duration**: 4-6 weeks

- Week 1-2: Pure hypothesis campaigns
- Week 3: Analysis and tuning
- Week 4: Agent-driven iteration
- Week 5-6: Refinement or breakthrough

**Ready to start**: Immediately after Phase 6 merge

## Next Steps

1. Merge Phase 6 branch to main 2. Create phase-7 branch 3. Run baseline K4 campaign (1000 attempts, existing params) 4.
Daily analysis and tuning 5. Iterate toward solution

---

**Bottom Line**: We have proven autonomous solvers for K1, K2, K3. K4 is the same puzzle family, just harder. We have
the tools. We have the infrastructure. Time to crack it.

Let's solve Kryptos. üîê
