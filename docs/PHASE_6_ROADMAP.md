## Critical Gap Analysis

### Current K1-K3 Success Rates (Tested 10/25/2025)
- **K1 Vigenère:** 100% ✅ (RELIABLE - can crack K1 end-to-end)
- **K2 Vigenère:** 3.8% ⚠️ (Alphabet variants not integrated)
- **K3 Transposition:** 27.5% ⚠️ (SA solver unreliable on known plaintext!)
- **Composite V+T:** 6.2% ⚠️ (Missing chain attacks)

### The Honest Assessment

**We built Ferrari-quality architecture but forgot to connect the wheels.**

✅ **What Works:**
- World-class infrastructure (564 tests, provenance tracking, docs)
- K1 standard Vigenère (100% reliable)
- Attack logging with deduplication
- Coverage metrics and search space tracking

⚠️ **What Doesn't:**
- Can't crack K2/K3 which we KNOW the answers to
- OPS agent still uses placeholder execution (line 360)
- No composite attack chains
- No adaptive learning from failures

### Critical Gaps (Priority Order)

1. **K3 Transposition** - BLOCKER: Can't crack known transposition (2-3 days) 2. **Real OPS Execution** - BLOCKER:
Placeholders prevent production use (2-3 days) 3. **K2 Alphabet Variants** - Code exists, needs wiring (2-3 days) 4.
**Composite Attacks** - V→T and T→V chains missing (4-5 days) 5. **Adaptive Learning** - No feedback loop from failures
(5-7 days)

**K4 Readiness Score: 40% (4/10 capabilities working)** **Bottom Line: We're NOT ready for K4 until we can crack K1-K3
reliably.**

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: K3 Transposition May Need Redesign
**Mitigation:** Parallel track: improve SA while researching alternatives (genetic algorithms, hill climbing variants)

### Risk 2: Composite Space is Exponential
**Mitigation:** Smart pruning, dictionary-guided search, early termination on high confidence

### Risk 3: K4 May Use Unknown Cipher
**Mitigation:** Exhaust known methods first, document provenance, prepare for novel techniques in Phase 7

### Risk 4: Community May Solve K4 First
**Mitigation:** Full provenance ensures our work contributes regardless, focus on academic rigor
