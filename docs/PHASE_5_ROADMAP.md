## Notes

### Technical Debt
- Placeholder execution in Phase 5.2 (blocking real results)
- No literature integration yet (missing attack vectors)
- Manual test organization needs improvement
- Some tests could be faster

### Dependencies
- Phase 5.3 required before 5.4 (need real results to filter)
- Phase 5.4 required before 5.5 (need success data to learn)
- Test audit should happen before Phase 5.6 (establish quality baseline)

### Risks
- Real cipher execution may be slower than expected
- SPY agent may not filter effectively (need tuning)
- Literature parsing may be manual-intensive
- Test audit may reveal systemic issues requiring refactoring
