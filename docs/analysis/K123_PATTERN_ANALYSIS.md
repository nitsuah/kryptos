# K1-K3 PATTERN ANALYSIS REPORT

Generated: 2025-10-25 01:20:57

## Overview

Analyzed 13 patterns across K1, K2, and K3. These patterns inform our K4 attack strategy.

## CIPHER PATTERNS

### 'NORTHEAST' clue (2020) - characters 26-34

**Confidence:** 1.00

### Evidence

- Sanborn confirmed 'NORTHEAST' appears in K4

**K4 Hypothesis:** Known plaintext: chars 26-34 = 'NORTHEAST'. This gives us a known-plaintext attack anchor point.
Combined with 'BERLIN' theme from K3, suggests Cold War espionage angle. Try ciphers where we can lock in NORTHEAST and
work outward.

### Increasing cipher complexity across sections

**Confidence:** 0.90

### Overall Evidence

- K1: Modified Vigenère with keyword
- K2: Vigenère with key + coordinate encoding
- K3: Keyed-alphabet transposition
- K4: ???

**K4 Hypothesis:** K4 is likely MOST complex. Expect: 1. Combination of previous techniques (polyalphabetic +
transposition) 2. Novel twist we haven't seen 3. Possible 'supercipher' using K1-K3 as keys/tables 4. Layered encryption
(decode once, then again)

## SPELLING PATTERNS

### Intentional misspellings/substitutions

**Confidence:** 0.95

### Misspelling Evidence

- 'iqlusion' instead of illusion (I→Q substitution)
- 'undergruund' instead of underground (O→U substitution)
- 'desparatly' instead of desperately (E missing)

**K4 Hypothesis:** K4 likely contains similar spelling quirks. Q↔I, U↔O substitutions may be intentional. Look for words
that are 'almost' English.

## THEME PATTERNS

### Theme: location

**Confidence:** 0.95

### Keyword Evidence

- north
- west
- degrees
- minutes
- seconds

**K4 Hypothesis:** K4 may continue location theme. Try these as cribs: north, west, degrees, minutes, seconds

### Theme: discovery

**Confidence:** 0.95

### Discovery Keywords

- slowly
- emerged
- breach
- peered
- see

**K4 Hypothesis:** K4 may continue discovery theme. Try these as cribs: slowly, emerged, breach, peered, see

### Theme: archaeology

**Confidence:** 0.95

### Archaeology Keywords

- debris
- doorway
- chamber
- remains
- passage

**K4 Hypothesis:** K4 may continue archaeology theme. Try these as cribs: debris, doorway, chamber, remains, passage

### Theme: communication

**Confidence:** 0.90

### Communication Keywords

- message
- transmitted
- information
- gathered

**K4 Hypothesis:** K4 may continue communication theme. Try these as cribs: message, transmitted, information, gathered

### Theme: secrecy

**Confidence:** 0.85

### Secrecy Keywords

- invisible
- buried
- unknown

**K4 Hypothesis:** K4 may continue secrecy theme. Try these as cribs: invisible, buried, unknown

## STRUCTURE PATTERNS

### 'X' used as separator/delimiter (5 times in K2)

**Confidence:** 0.90

### Structure Evidence

- X marks section breaks
- Separates distinct ideas

**K4 Hypothesis:** K4 might use X or other symbols as delimiters. Don't treat X as normal letter - it could mark
boundaries, layers, or metadata.

### Geographic coordinates embedded in plaintext

**Confidence:** 0.85

### Geo Evidence

- 38°57'6.5"N, 77°8'44"W - CIA headquarters location

**K4 Hypothesis:** K4 might contain coordinates, dates, or other numeric encodings. Look for number patterns, especially
related to Kryptos location or key dates. Or an X,Y,Z coordinate system.

### Preferred word lengths: 3, 4, 7, 6, 5

**Confidence:** 0.75

### Keyword Length Evidence

- 3-letter words: 35 times
- 4-letter words: 26 times
- 7-letter words: 21 times
- 6-letter words: 15 times
- 5-letter words: 13 times

**K4 Hypothesis:** K4 likely has similar word length distribution. When testing transpositions, favor plaintext with 3-4
letter words.

## ARTISTIC PATTERNS

### K1 uses poetic, artistic language

**Confidence:** 0.85

### Poetic Evidence

- subtle
- shading
- absence
- light
- nuance
- iqlusion

**K4 Hypothesis:** K4 may be poetic or philosophical. Sanborn is an artist - expect metaphor, symbolism, beauty. SPY's
poetry detection (rhyme, meter, alliteration) will be crucial.

### K3 quotes historical event (King Tut discovery, 1922)

**Confidence:** 0.80

### Tut Evidence

- slowly desparatly
- chamber
- candle
- mist
- can you see anything

**K4 Hypothesis:** K4 might quote another historical event, literary work, or famous text. Check cryptography history,
CIA history, Cold War events. The 'WW' in K2 might be Wolfgang Weber or another real person.

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR K4

Based on K1-K3 analysis, prioritize:

1. **Known-plaintext attacks** using 'NORTHEAST' (chars 26-34) 2. **Spelling-aware search** - expect Q↔I, U↔O

substitutions 3. **Thematic cribs** - Try 'BERLIN', 'CLOCK', Cold War terms 4. **Poetry/artistic validation** - SPY NLP
to detect Sanborn's style 5. **Supercipher hypothesis** - K4 might use K1-K3 as keys 6. **Historical quotes** - K3 is
King Tut, K4 might quote something similar
