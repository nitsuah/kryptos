## 🔬 Experiment 1: K1 Vigenère Recovery (100% Expected)

### Input Data

```python
K1_CIPHERTEXT = "EMUFPHZLRFAXYUSDJKZLDKRNSHGNFIVJ"
K1_EXPECTED_KEY = "PALIMPSEST"
K1_EXPECTED_PLAINTEXT = "BETWEENSUBTLESHADINGANDTHEABSENC"
```

### Execution Script

```bash
# Run K1 validation
python scripts/test_k123_unified_pipeline.py
```

### Expected Output

```
Testing K1 Vigenère recovery...
Ciphertext: EMUFPHZLRFAXYUSDJKZLDKRNSHGNFIVJ
Expected plaintext: BETWEENSUBTLESHADINGANDTHEABSENC
Recovered plaintext: BETWEENSUBTLESHADINGANDTHEABSENC
Match: 20/20 characters (100.0%)
✓ PERFECT MATCH
```

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Match Rate:** 20/20 (100%)
- [ ] **Key Recovered:** PALIMPSEST
- [ ] **Execution Time:** <5 seconds
- [ ] **No Errors/Warnings**

### Troubleshooting

**If match < 100%:** 1. Verify K1 ciphertext is correct (check for typos) 2. Confirm dictionary scoring function is
using English frequency table 3. Check that key length enumeration includes length 10

**If execution time > 30s:** 1. Verify numpy/scipy installed correctly 2. Check CPU usage (should be near 100% during
key testing)

## 🔬 Experiment 2: K3 Transposition Recovery (100% Expected)

### Input Data

```python
K3_CIPHERTEXT = "ENDYAHROHNLSRHEOCPTEOIBIDYSHNAIA..." # (80 chars, see test file)
K3_EXPECTED_PLAINTEXT = "SLOWLYDESPARATLYSLOWLYTHEREMAINSOFPASSAGE..."
```

### Execution Script

```bash
# Run K3 validation (same script as K1)
python scripts/test_k123_unified_pipeline.py
```

### Expected Output

```
Testing K3 transposition recovery...
Ciphertext (80 chars): ENDYAHROHNLSRHEOCPTEOIBIDYSHNAIA...
Expected plaintext: SLOWLYDESPARATLYSLOWLYTHEREMAINSOFPASSAGE...
Method: Simulated annealing (50,000 iterations)
Recovered plaintext: SLOWLYDESPARATLYSLOWLYTHEREMAINSOFPASSAGE...
Match: 80/80 characters (100.0%)
✓ PERFECT MATCH
```

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Match Rate:** 80/80 (100%)
- [ ] **Method:** Simulated annealing
- [ ] **Execution Time:** 2-10 seconds
- [ ] **Score:** >0.80 on dictionary metric

### Troubleshooting

**If match < 100%:** 1. Increase SA iterations: Try 100,000 instead of 50,000 2. Verify dictionary scoring is working
(test on known plaintext) 3. Check initial temperature parameter (should be ~10.0)

**If match = 0% (completely wrong):** 1. Verify K3 ciphertext integrity (80 characters, uppercase) 2. Check columnar
transposition implementation 3. Test exhaustive search on smaller sample (period 4-5)
