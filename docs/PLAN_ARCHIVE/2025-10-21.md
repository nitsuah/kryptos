# Close-up summary for 2025-10-21

Today we completed the core pipeline scaffolding and added focused tests to increase coverage.

Done:

- Stage interface spec and placeholder types implemented.
- Unit tests for stage interface and negative pruning behavior added.
- Extended scoring with crib bonuses and Berlin clock validator; added cached combined scoring.
- Pipeline executor implemented with pruning, CSV artifact export, dynamic gating heuristics, and
performance counters.
- Parallel hill-variant scaffolding added.
- Tuning harness scaffold (`scripts/tune_pipeline.py`) created.
- Multiple unit tests added; coverage raised above 92% (total ~92.8%).

Pending (short list):

- Close remaining coverage gaps in `src/k4/scoring.py` (target branches ~135-157 and related edge
cases).
- Add transposition edge-case tests to bring `src/k4/transposition.py` above 90%.
- Finalize tuning script and run initial parameter sweeps.
- Optionally remove deprecated autofix stubs after review.

Notes:

- Tests are fast; full suite runs in ~3s locally and produces artifacts in
`artifacts/run_<timestamp>/` on sample runs.
- `tests/conftest.py` centralizes path setup for reliable test imports.

â€” end of day
