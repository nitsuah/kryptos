# INTELLIGENCE IDEAS

- SPY - should gather more sources with the goal to find new cribs or keywords to test in our ciphers/etc.
- OPS - should implement more advanced analysis techniques, such as frequency analysis, n-gram analysis, and pattern
recognition to identify potential weaknesses in ciphers.
- Q - should focus on optimizing the performance of the cryptanalysis process, including parallel processing, caching
results, and using more efficient algorithms to speed up the analysis. But also recommendations on other agents and
overall test & performance monitoring.
- LLM - adding some advanced prompting techniques, such as few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and self-
reflection to improve the quality of the generated hypotheses and analyses. but most of this can feed into the MD files
so an LLM agent can read them and use the knowledge as we also work side by side to improve the overall system (ie:
Cursor, VSCode, Copilot, etc).
