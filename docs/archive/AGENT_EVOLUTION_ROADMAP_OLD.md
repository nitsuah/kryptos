# Agent Evolution Roadmap
## Multi-Agent Cryptanalysis System Enhancement

**Vision:** Transform the agent system into a self-improving, collaborative network with expanding expertise and
external knowledge integration.

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE: SPY v2.0 Completion (Current)

### Status: 70% Complete
- ‚úÖ NLP infrastructure (spaCy + NLTK WordNet)
- ‚úÖ spy_nlp.py module with NER/POS/dependency/semantic analysis
- ‚úÖ Integration into SPY agent
- ‚è≥ Testing & validation (requires complete sentences)
- ‚è≥ Documentation

### Key Finding:
NLP works great on complete sentences but needs full plaintext context. Short fragments don't parse well. This is
actually desirable - we want to reward coherent English text.
