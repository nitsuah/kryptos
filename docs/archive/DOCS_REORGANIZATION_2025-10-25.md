# Documentation Reorganization Summary

**Date:** October 25, 2025 **Impact:** Improved clarity, reduced clutter (12 → 3 core files in docs/)

---

## Changes Made

### Structure Before
```
docs/
├── README.md (434 lines, duplicate content)
├── PHASE_5_BRIEFING.md
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── INDEX.md (redundant with README)
├── 30_YEAR_GAP_COVERAGE.md
├── K123_PATTERN_ANALYSIS.md
├── AGENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md
├── AUTONOMOUS_SYSTEM.md
├── API_REFERENCE.md
├── PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md (outdated profiling)
├── SCORING_CALIBRATION.md (historical calibration)
├── sources/
└── archive/
```

### Structure After
```
docs/
├── README.md (clean, 110 lines, navigation-focused)

## Rationale

### Problems Solved

1. **Too many files in root** - 12 markdown files → 3 core files
   - Hard to find what you need
   - Unclear what's current vs historical

2. **Redundant navigation** - INDEX.md duplicated README content
   - Two places to maintain the same information
   - README now serves as single entry point

3. **Mixed purposes** - Technical docs, research, and planning all in root
   - Unclear what's reference vs active work
   - Folder structure now makes purpose clear

4. **Outdated content in main docs** - Profiling data from weeks ago
   - PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md → archive (historical profiling)
   - SCORING_CALIBRATION.md → archive (historical calibration)

### New Organization Principles

**docs/ (root)** - Only current, essential files:
- README.md - Navigation and quick start
- PHASE_5_BRIEFING.md - Active work
- CHANGELOG.md - Version history

**docs/reference/** - "How does it work?"
- Technical architecture
- System design
- API documentation

**docs/analysis/** - "What did we learn?"
- Research findings
- Coverage assessments
- Pattern analysis

**docs/sources/** - "What did Sanborn say?"
- Primary source materials
- Artist statements
- Confirmed clues

**docs/archive/** - "What happened before?"
- Historical documents
- Session reports
- Superseded content

---

## Impact

### Metrics
- Core docs: 12 → 3 (75% reduction in root clutter)
- Total docs: Same (~12-13 total, just better organized)
- Folders: 2 → 5 (better categorization)

### User Experience
**Before:** "Which doc do I read? What's the difference between README and INDEX?" **After:** "Start with README, drill
into folders as needed"

### Maintenance
**Before:** Update both README and INDEX when structure changes **After:** Single source of truth in README

## Migration Guide

### If you had bookmarks to old paths:

| Old Path | New Path |
|----------|----------|
| `docs/30_YEAR_GAP_COVERAGE.md` | `docs/analysis/30_YEAR_GAP_COVERAGE.md` |
| `docs/K123_PATTERN_ANALYSIS.md` | `docs/analysis/K123_PATTERN_ANALYSIS.md` |
| `docs/AGENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md` | `docs/reference/AGENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| `docs/AUTONOMOUS_SYSTEM.md` | `docs/reference/AUTONOMOUS_SYSTEM.md` |
| `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` | `docs/reference/API_REFERENCE.md` |
| `docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md` | `docs/archive/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md` |
| `docs/SCORING_CALIBRATION.md` | `docs/archive/SCORING_CALIBRATION.md` |
| `docs/INDEX.md` | Removed (use README.md) |

### If you were linking from code/comments:

Update relative links:
```python
# Before
# See docs/AGENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md for details

# After
# See docs/reference/AGENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md for details
```

---

## Verification

All links tested:
```bash
# Check for broken links in README
python -m scripts.lint.mdlint docs/README.md

# Verify folder structure
ls docs/
ls docs/reference/
ls docs/analysis/
ls docs/sources/
ls docs/archive/
```

All files accounted for - nothing lost, just reorganized.

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Update CHANGELOG.md with reorganization notes 2. ✅ Create this summary document 3. Future: Update any scripts/tools
that reference old paths 4. Future: Consider combining CHANGELOG.md content into README if it gets too long

---

**Result:** Cleaner, more intuitive documentation structure. Easy to find what you need, clear what's current vs
historical.
