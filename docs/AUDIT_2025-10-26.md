# Kryptos Codebase Audit - October 26, 2025

## Executive Summary

**What Actually Works:**
- ✅ K1/K2 autonomous Vigenère key recovery (tests passing, single-case validated)
- ✅ K3 known-solution decryption (double rotational transposition)
- ✅ Core infrastructure (agents, pipeline, scoring, provenance)

**What's Missing/Untested:**
- ❌ K3 autonomous solving (SA solver exists but NO TESTS)
- ❌ Monte Carlo validation (no multi-run success rate testing)
- ❌ K4 composite attack validation

**Root Cause:** Building new features without testing existing ones. 593 tests but many test infrastructure, not
autonomous solving capability.

## K1/K2/K3 Autonomous Capability - FACTS

### K1 (Vigenère, 64 chars, 10-char key "PALIMPSEST")

**Status:** ✅ **WORKING** (as of Oct 26)

**How It Works:** 1. Hybrid frequency scoring: absolute difference for short columns (<10 chars), chi-squared for longer
2. Rank-prioritized candidate generation: generates keys by rank-sum (low ranks first) 3. Dictionary ranking:
prioritizes real English words (PALIMPSEST gets +1000 score) 4. Result: PALIMPSEST at position #1 in top 10

**Evidence:**
- Test: `tests/test_vigenere_key_recovery.py::TestAutonomousKeyRecovery::test_k1_autonomous_recovery_no_key_provided` ✅
PASSING
- Script: `scripts/test_k1_recovery.py` - finds PALIMPSEST at rank #1

**Limitations:**
- Only tested on SINGLE case (the real K1 cipher)
- No Monte Carlo validation (100+ runs with random noise/mutations)
- Success rate unknown - could be 100% or 1% (just got lucky)

**Method:**
- `src/kryptos/k4/vigenere_key_recovery.py::recover_key_by_frequency()`
- Uses per-column frequency analysis + dictionary ranking
- 500k candidate generation with rank-prioritized heap

---

### K2 (Vigenère, ~336 chars, 8-char key "ABSCISSA")

**Status:** ✅ **WORKING**

**How It Works:** 1. Same method as K1 (longer cipher = more reliable frequency analysis) 2. Dictionary ranking
prioritizes ABSCISSA (real word) 3. Result: ABSCISSA at position #1 in top 10

**Evidence:**
- Test: `tests/test_vigenere_key_recovery.py::TestAutonomousKeyRecovery::test_k2_autonomous_recovery_no_key_provided` ✅
PASSING
- Script: `scripts/test_k2_recovery.py` - finds ABSCISSA at rank #1

**Limitations:**
- Same as K1: single-case validation only
- No Monte Carlo testing

**Contradiction:**
- Phase 6 roadmap claims "K2: 3.8% success rate"
- Tests show 100% success on the one case we test
- Unknown which is correct (Monte Carlo needed)

---

### K3 (Columnar Transposition, 336 chars, published solution)

**Status:** ⚠️ **KNOWN SOLUTION ONLY - NO AUTONOMOUS TEST**

**What Exists:**

1. **Known Solution Decryption** ✅ WORKS
   - `src/kryptos/ciphers.py::k3_decrypt()` - double rotational transposition
   - `src/kryptos/k3/decrypt()` - wrapper
   - Uses PUBLISHED algorithm (24x14 grid → rotate → 8 cols → rotate)
   - **NOT autonomous** - executes known solution

2. **Autonomous Solving Infrastructure** ❓ UNTESTED
   - `src/kryptos/k4/transposition_analysis.py` (1002 lines)
   - Period detection via IOC analysis
   - Multiple solvers:
     - `solve_columnar_permutation_simulated_annealing()` - 150k iterations
     - `solve_columnar_permutation_exhaustive()` - for small periods
     - `solve_columnar_permutation_multi_start()` - hill climbing
   - **NO TESTS** for any of these functions

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ grep -r "solve_columnar_permutation" tests/
# NO RESULTS

$ grep -r "transposition_analysis" tests/
# NO RESULTS
```

**K3 Tests That Exist:**
- `test_ciphers.py::test_k3_decrypt` - tests KNOWN solution decryption
- `test_transposition.py::test_k3_decrypt_size_error` - error handling
- SPY tests on K3 plaintext - scoring only

**How Was K3 Actually Solved? (Historical)** Jim Sanborn published the solution in 1999 after it was solved by CIA
employees:
- Period: Not standard columnar (uses rotational transposition)
- Method: 24×14 character grid
- First rotation: 90° clockwise
- Reshape to 8 columns (42 rows)
- Second rotation: 90° clockwise
- Read result row by row

Our `k3_decrypt()` implements THIS published algorithm, not autonomous discovery.

**Can We Solve K3 Autonomously?**
- Phase 6 roadmap claims "K3: 27.5% success rate"
- **NO CODE OR TESTS** to validate this claim
- SA solver exists but success rate unknown
- Would need:
1. Test that encrypts plaintext with random columnar transposition 2. Runs SA solver to recover permutation 3. Measures
success rate over 100+ runs

## Test Suite Audit

### Current Status: 593 Tests

**Breakdown by Category:**

1. **Infrastructure Tests** (~60% of tests)
   - Agent tests (SPY, OPS, Q, coordination)
   - Pipeline tests (stages, executors)
   - Provenance tests (logging, deduplication)
   - CLI tests (subcommands, logging)
   - Utility tests (scoring, ciphers, coherence)

2. **Cipher Implementation Tests** (~30%)
   - Encryption/decryption correctness
   - Edge cases, error handling
   - Vigenère, transposition, Hill, Playfair, etc.

3. **Autonomous Solving Tests** (~10% - MOST CRITICAL)
   - ✅ K1/K2 Vigenère recovery (2 tests)
   - ❌ K3 autonomous solving (0 tests)
   - ❌ K4 composite attacks (some integration tests, no validation)
   - ❌ Monte Carlo validation (0 tests)

**Quality Issues:**

1. **Aspirational Tests**
   - Some tests pass but don't validate real autonomous capability
   - Example: Test passes if function returns *something*, not if it's correct

2. **Missing Critical Tests**
   - No tests for `transposition_analysis.py` SA solver
   - No multi-run success rate validation
   - No robustness testing (noise, mutations, variations)

3. **Integration vs. Unit Confusion**
   - Some "unit" tests are actually integration tests (slow, brittle)
   - Some integration tests mock too much (don't test real behavior)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Are We Struggling?

**Your Question:** "Others clearly solved this, why are we struggling?"

**Answer:**

1. **We're Building Infrastructure, Not Solving K1/K2/K3**
   - K1/K2 solutions exist (Vigenère with frequency analysis)
   - We built a complex agent/pipeline/provenance system
   - Then tried to bolt on K1/K2 solving as an afterthought
   - **Should have been:** Solve K1/K2 first, THEN build infrastructure around what works

2. **No Validation of What We Build**
   - Built SA solver for transposition - never tested it
   - Built agents - don't use them for K1/K2
   - Built pipeline - K1/K2 tests bypass it
   - **Pattern:** Build shiny tool → assume it works → move on

3. **Script Sprawl Instead of Iteration**
   - Create `test_k1_recovery.py` → works
   - Don't integrate into `tests/`
   - Next day: create `debug_k1_positions.py` instead of improving first script
   - **Pattern:** Always creating new throwaway scripts instead of iterating

4. **Aspirational Documentation**
   - README claims validation scripts exist (they don't)
   - Roadmap claims success rates with no supporting evidence
   - **Pattern:** Write what we WANT to have, not what we HAVE

### What Others Did Differently

**K1 Solution (1992):** CIA analyst Jim Gillogly
- Method: Vigenère frequency analysis
- Simple, direct approach
- Likely no fancy infrastructure

**K2 Solution (1992):** Same as K1
- Method: Same frequency analysis
- Key difference: Longer ciphertext = more reliable

**K3 Solution (1998-1999):** Team at NSA
- Method: Unknown (result published by Sanborn)
- Likely: Manual cryptanalysis + some computational support
- Not fully autonomous

**Our Mistake:** Trying to build a general "K4 solving machine" before validating we can solve K1/K2/K3 the simple way.

**Validation Scripts (Deleted in Commit ec01d2b, Oct 25):**
- `scripts/validation/validate_known_kryptos.py` (219 lines)
- `scripts/validation/test_k123_unified_pipeline.py` (274 lines)
- `scripts/validation/test_k3_transposition.py` (201 lines)
- `scripts/validation/test_k4_execution.py` (76 lines)

**Total: ~770 lines of validation code deleted**

**Reason for Deletion (Git commit message):** > "Refactor and remove deprecated validation scripts"

**Were They Useful?**
- Possibly - they called K1/K2/K3 solving methods
- Probably redundant with `tests/` once those tests existed
- BUT: They might have had Monte Carlo or multi-run testing that's now missing

**Should They Be Recovered?**
- Need to check if they had functionality not in current tests
- If just duplicate of tests → leave deleted
- If had unique validation (Monte Carlo, stress testing) → recover and integrate

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities (Next 3 Days)

1. **Test K3 Autonomous Solving** (1 day)
   - Create test in `tests/test_transposition_autonomous.py`
   - Generate random columnar transposition cipher
   - Run SA solver, measure success rate
   - Document actual capability vs. roadmap claims

2. **Monte Carlo Validation** (1 day)
   - Add `tests/test_k1_k2_monte_carlo.py`
   - Run K1 recovery 100 times with slight variations
   - Run K2 recovery 100 times
   - Measure success rate, variance, failure modes
   - Update documentation with REAL success rates

3. **Audit & Clean** (1 day)
   - Review validation scripts in git history
   - Extract any unique functionality
   - Move useful scripts to proper tests
   - Delete true duplicates
   - Update README to match reality

### Strategic Decisions Required

**Choice A: Focus on K4 (Use Existing Infrastructure)**
- Assume K1/K2/K3 methods work (they pass tests)
- Use agent/pipeline architecture for K4 composite attacks
- Build on existing infrastructure
- **Risk:** K1/K2/K3 methods might fail at scale (no Monte Carlo validation)

**Choice B: Validate Foundation First**
- Test K1/K2/K3 thoroughly (Monte Carlo, robustness)
- Ensure methods are rock-solid before K4
- Integrate methods with agent/pipeline architecture
- **Risk:** More "prep work" before K4 attempts

**My Recommendation:** **Choice B with time limit**
- 3 days: Validate K1/K2/K3 thoroughly
- Then: Move to K4 using validated methods
- Reason: Better to know K1/K2/K3 work (or don't) before building on them

## Process Improvements

### Stop Doing:
1. Creating throwaway debug scripts - iterate on existing scripts or tests 2. Writing aspirational documentation before
building feature 3. Assuming infrastructure works without testing it 4. Building features without validation tests

### Start Doing:
1. Write validation test FIRST, then implement feature 2. One script per purpose - iterate on it, don't create new ones
3. Document what EXISTS, not what's planned 4. Clean up after ourselves (delete debug artifacts) 5. Monte Carlo test
anything claiming autonomous solving

### Code Review Checklist (For AI Agent):
- [ ] Does this feature have a test that validates it works?
- [ ] Is this a duplicate of existing functionality?
- [ ] Am I creating a throwaway debug script instead of iterating?
- [ ] Does documentation match reality?
- [ ] If claiming success rate, is it measured or assumed?

## Conclusion

**Can we solve K1/K2/K3 autonomously?**

- K1: ✅ YES (1 test passing, needs Monte Carlo)
- K2: ✅ YES (1 test passing, needs Monte Carlo)
- K3: ❓ UNKNOWN (solver exists, zero tests)

**Will we get to K4 at current rate?**

Honestly: **NO**

We're building faster than we're validating. 593 tests give false confidence - most test infrastructure, not solving
capability. Need to slow down, validate what we have, then move forward.

**Next Steps:** 1. Test K3 autonomous solving (1 day) 2. Monte Carlo K1/K2 (1 day) 3. Clean up scripts (1 day) 4. Then
decide: K4 or more foundation work
