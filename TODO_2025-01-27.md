     - Period 6: **83%** (claimed 27.5%) - 3.0x better
     - Period 7: **95%** (claimed 27.5%) - 3.5x better
   - Files: `tests/test_k3_autonomous_solving.py`, `tests/test_k3_monte_carlo_comprehensive.py`
   - Documentation: `K3_VALIDATION_RESULTS.md`

2. **K1/K2 Autonomous Recovery** - VERIFIED WORKING
   - Both tests passing (PALIMPSEST #1, ABSCISSA #1)
   - Hybrid scoring fix confirmed stable

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- None currently

### ðŸ“‹ Today's Tasks

#### 1. K1/K2 Monte Carlo Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Goal:** Get real success rates with confidence intervals, not just single-case validation.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `tests/test_k1_k2_monte_carlo.py`
- [ ] Test K1 recovery 50 times with variations (different random seeds, noise in scoring)
- [ ] Test K2 recovery 50 times similarly
- [ ] Measure: success rate, variance, failure modes, time per run
- [ ] Document results similar to K3_VALIDATION_RESULTS.md
- [ ] Compare to roadmap claim (K2: "3.8%" - likely outdated/wrong?)

**Expected Outcome:** Validate that K1/K2 success rates are high (>90%?) with tight confidence intervals.

---

#### 2. Review Deleted Validation Scripts (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Goal:** Recover any unique testing logic from deleted validation scripts before confirming deletion was correct.

**Context:**
- Commit `ec01d2b` (Oct 25) deleted 770 lines including:
  - `scripts/validation/validate_known_kryptos.py` (219 lines)
  - `scripts/validation/test_k123_unified_pipeline.py` (274 lines)
  - `scripts/validation/test_k3_transposition.py` (201 lines)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] `git show ec01d2b^:scripts/validation/validate_known_kryptos.py > /tmp/old_validation.py`
- [ ] Review for: Monte Carlo testing, stress testing, robustness checks not in current tests/
- [ ] Extract useful patterns (e.g., parameter sweeps, edge cases, failure analysis)
- [ ] Migrate unique logic to appropriate test files in `tests/`
- [ ] Document what was recovered vs what was truly redundant
- [ ] Confirm deletion was appropriate OR note what was lost

**Expected Outcome:** Either validate deletion was correct, or recover valuable test patterns.

---

#### 3. Update Roadmap with Measured Metrics (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Goal:** Replace aspirational claims with measured reality.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update `PHASE_6_ROADMAP.md` with validated success rates:
  - K1: [measured %] Â± [CI] (from Monte Carlo)
  - K2: [measured %] Â± [CI] (from Monte Carlo)
  - K3 single columnar: 68-95% (validated)
  - K3 double-transposition: 27.5%? (UNTESTED - mark as needs validation)
- [ ] Remove/clarify any unverified claims
- [ ] Add methodology note (50-run Monte Carlo, 95% confidence intervals)
- [ ] Document test coverage status

**Expected Outcome:** Roadmap reflects reality, clearly distinguishes tested vs untested capabilities.

---

#### 4. Comprehensive Repository Audit (HIGH PRIORITY - NEW)
**Goal:** Ensure codebase stays clean, relevant, and well-tested. Create sustainable maintenance process.

This is a **multi-phase audit** that should be done systematically:

##### Phase A: Documentation Audit (`docs/` and all subdirs)
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Review every markdown file in `docs/` for:
  - Relevance (still accurate? outdated?)
  - Consolidation opportunities (multiple docs covering same topic?)
  - Deletion candidates (no longer relevant?)
- [ ] Update common/key docs to reflect current state
- [ ] Create `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` - organized directory of all docs with descriptions
- [ ] Document audit findings in `docs/audits/DOCS_AUDIT_2025-01-27.md`

**Key Documents to Review:**
- Architecture docs
- API docs
- Design decisions
- Historical notes (keep for context vs delete for clutter?)

##### Phase B: Scripts Audit (`scripts/`)
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Review every script for:
  - **Working scripts:** Should be converted to tests in `tests/`
  - **Functional code:** Should be integrated into `src/kryptos/` as APIs/utilities
  - **One-off debugging:** Delete if no longer needed
  - **Useful dev tools:** Document and keep with README
- [ ] For each working script:
  - Convert logic to test (or validate test exists)
  - Extract reusable code to `src/kryptos/` with proper API
  - Add logging/config similar to existing code
  - Delete script once functionality is integrated
- [ ] Create `scripts/README.md` explaining what remains and why
- [ ] Document audit findings in `docs/audits/SCRIPTS_AUDIT_2025-01-27.md`

**Current Scripts to Audit:**
- `test_k1_recovery.py` - should be in tests/
- `test_k2_recovery.py` - should be in tests/
- `test_ranking.py` - should be in tests/
- `test_raw_generation.py` - should be in tests/
- `debug_k2_positions.py` - keep or delete?
- `test_col_positions.py` - should be in tests/
- `test_column_scoring.py` - should be in tests/

##### Phase C: Tests Audit (`tests/`)
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Review all 593+ tests for:
  - **Relevance:** Does it test current functionality?
  - **Effectiveness:** Does it catch real bugs or just pass trivially?
  - **Coverage gaps:** What's NOT being tested?
  - **Redundancy:** Multiple tests covering exact same thing?
  - **Quality:** Well-written, maintainable, clear intent?
- [ ] Run coverage analysis: `pytest --cov=src/kryptos --cov-report=html`
- [ ] Identify high-value test additions (critical paths with low coverage)
- [ ] Identify low-value tests (trivial assertions, outdated functionality)
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Don't just delete tests - understand them first
  - If test seems bad, determine WHY
  - Consider replacement with better test
  - Only delete if truly redundant/obsolete AND you're certain
- [ ] Document findings in `docs/audits/TESTS_AUDIT_2025-01-27.md`

**Specific Analysis:**
- Infrastructure tests (agent, pipeline, provenance) - are these valuable?
- Autonomous solving tests - coverage of K1/K2/K3?
- Edge cases - are we testing failure modes?
- Integration tests - do we have end-to-end validation?

##### Phase D: Code Coverage Analysis
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Generate current coverage report
- [ ] Identify critical code paths with <80% coverage
- [ ] Prioritize coverage improvements by risk (crypto logic > infrastructure)
- [ ] Create targeted tests for uncovered critical paths
- [ ] Document coverage goals per module in `docs/audits/COVERAGE_ANALYSIS_2025-01-27.md`

##### Phase E: Technical Debt Plan
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Synthesize findings from Phases A-D into `docs/TECHDEBT_PLAN.md`
- [ ] Categorize debt:
  - **Critical:** Must fix (security, correctness bugs)
  - **High:** Should fix soon (coverage gaps, confusing code)
  - **Medium:** Nice to have (refactoring, optimization)
  - **Low:** Cosmetic (style, naming)
- [ ] Create prioritized backlog with effort estimates
- [ ] Define maintenance cadence:
  - Weekly: Review new tests for quality
  - Monthly: Quick audit of docs/scripts
  - Quarterly: Full audit like this one

##### Phase F: Maintenance Framework
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `docs/MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md` - how to keep codebase tidy
  - When to add tests vs scripts
  - When to update docs vs create new ones
  - Code review checklist
  - Definition of "done" for features
  - Audit procedures (use this process as template)
- [ ] Add breadcrumb to `CONTRIBUTING.md` pointing to maintenance guide
- [ ] Create audit checklist template for future audits
- [ ] Document AI agent prompts that help with maintenance

**Maintenance Principles:** 1. **Tests are sacred** - understand deeply before modifying/deleting 2. **Docs decay** -
prune regularly, consolidate aggressively 3. **Scripts are temporary** - production them or delete them 4. **Coverage
matters** - but 100% coverage â‰  good tests 5. **Knowledge preservation** - keep context, delete clutter

establishes cleanliness) 3. **Scripts Audit** (Phase B - convert to tests, integrate functional code) 4. **Tests Audit**
(Phase C - most critical, requires deep understanding) 5. **Coverage Analysis** (Phase D - data-driven test
improvements) 6. **Tech Debt Plan** (Phase E - synthesize everything) 7. **Maintenance Framework** (Phase F -
sustainable process) 8. **Review Deleted Scripts** (if time permits) 9. **Update Roadmap** (final step, after all data
gathered)

---

### ðŸ’¡ Notes

**On Test Deletion:**
- Tests are our safety net - they preserve knowledge about what SHOULD work
- Before deleting ANY test, ask:
  - What behavior is it validating?
  - Is that behavior still required?
  - Is there another test that covers this?
  - Could this catch a regression we care about?
- If replacing a test, run BOTH old and new until certain new one is better
- Document WHY tests are deleted (not just THAT they were deleted)

**On Script Integration:**
- Scripts in `scripts/` that work should become tests
- Reusable logic should become `src/kryptos/` APIs
- One-off debugging scripts should be deleted
- Development tools should be documented and kept

**On Documentation:**
- Docs should be discoverable (index/map)
- Outdated docs are worse than no docs
- Consolidate similar docs aggressively
- Keep historical context but mark it as such

**On AI Agent Assistance:**
- The maintenance guide should include prompts that help AI understand context
- Checklists make AI execution more reliable
- Document the "why" behind processes, not just the "what"
- Breadcrumbs in CONTRIBUTING.md help AI navigate
