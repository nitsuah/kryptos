# Note: to allow commenting/labeling from workflows triggered by PRs (and when using
# the GITHUB_TOKEN), explicit permissions are required. For PRs from forks, GitHub
# restricts write operations; consider using pull_request_target for trusted runs.

  # use pull_request_target to allow workflows to use repo secrets safely for labeling

            Thanks for the PR â€” automated checks will run (fast smoke + tests).
            If you'd like reviewers requested automatically, set the `REVIEWERS` secret (comma-separated GitHub logins) in the repo settings and this workflow will request them.
