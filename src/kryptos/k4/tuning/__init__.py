"""Tuning utilities for K4 scoring heuristics.

This subpackage centralizes lightweight experimental helpers that were
previously implemented as ad-hoc scripts under ``scripts/tuning``.

Only stable, sideâ€‘effect free functions are exported here so they can be
unit tested and (optionally) wired into the CLI. File / artifact emitting
logic stays thin and is orchestrated by wrappers or future CLI commands.
